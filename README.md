  This project aims to educate developers, software engineers, and website owners about the importance of secure web development practices. It includes a demonstration of a common vulnerability found in a contest voting website, along with guidelines on responsible disclosure and how to mitigate such issues. The project's primary goal is to promote ethical hacking and encourage a proactive approach towards building robust and secure websites.
